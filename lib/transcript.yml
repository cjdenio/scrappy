  css:
    'noargs': To link a custom CSS file, type \`/scrappy setcss\` followed by a link to a CSS file online. Try this one, which sets your background to hot pink! \`/scrappy setcss https://gist.github.com/MatthewStanciu/a0c10a8d4264b737fcc3c1724591c232\`
    'removed': Your CSS file has been removed from your profile. If you would like to re-add it, type \`/scrappy setcss <link to css file>\`.
    'set': '<${this.url}|Your CSS file> has been linked to your profile! Check it out: \`https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/${this.username}\`'
    'nocss': You linked a Gist, but there isnâ€™t a .css file on your Gist. Try again with the raw URL to the CSS.
  domain:
    'noargs': To link a custom domain to your scrapbook, type \`/scrappy setdomain\` followed by the domain or subdomain you want to link. e.g. \`/scrappy setdomain scrapbook.zachlatta.com\`. Then, create a CNAME record in your DNS provider for your domain and point it to \`cname.vercel-dns.com\`.
    'overlimit': Couldn't set your domain. Only 50 custom domains can be added to a project, and 50 people have already added their custom domains.
    'domainexists': Couldn't set your domain \`${this.text}\`. You can't add a domain if it's already set to another Vercel project. Try again with a different domain.
    'domainset':
      - |
        Custom domain \`${this.text}\` set!
        
        *Your next steps*: create a CNAME record in your DNS provider for your domain and point it to \`cname.vercel-dns.com\`.

        You're one of 50 people who can add a custom domain during the Summer of Making. There are *${this.domainsLeft}* domains spots left.
  errors:
    'filetype': Your filetype isn't supported. Make sure you\'re uploading a video and try again.
    'heic': The HEIC filetype isn't supported. I recommend <https://heictojpg.com|converting your image to jpg> and reuploading.
